# Crypto Tracker

[Deployed App](https://cryptotrackersf.netlify.app/)

## Description

A simple application that provides the top market cap cryptocurrencies via a scrolling ticker, while also allowing the user to search and favorite the coins they wish to monitor. I was looking to create an application I would be pationate about while also being relevant in today's pop culture and economics.

## Technologies

This app was created using Javascript, React, Redux(toolkit), CSS3 and CoinGecko API.

## Shoutout

A special thanks to the team at CoinGecko for making an extremely user friendly and data rich API.
